            <pre>       Mini Rexes originated in France in the late 1800s. A recessive gene makes the Rex's hair stick out from their 
bodies instead of lying flat, and their outer layer of fur is shorter than that of most breeds. This means that you can feel 
their exceptionally soft, velvety undercoat.
                
                As the name implies, they are fairly small in size (they weigh between 3.5 and 4.5 lbs fully grown) and are 
incredibly friendly. There is little reason to question why they are one of the most popular rabbit breeds in America.

        <h2 align="center"><b>About the Breed</b> </h2>
        <pre>       Holland Lops are popular show rabbits. The breed originated in the Netherlands and was officially recognized by 
the American Rabbit Breeders Association in 1979. They are a dwarf breed, meaning they are on the small side for rabbits. 
The standard Holland Lop weighs between 2 and 4 lbs and can have either broken or solid coloring in a wide 
variety of colors.

            Holland Lops are excitable by nature, so they are fun to play with but can also be a little difficult to get 
in and out of their cages. They probably aren't the best breed for families with children. While they can get along 
well with children, they will struggle if they don't feel like being held, so be sure to supervise any playtime 
with the rabbit.</pre>
    
            <h2 align="center"><b>Personality</b></h2>
            <pre> Very energetic, active, and friendly but will resist being picked up and held. </pre>

        <h2 align="center"><b>About the Breed</b> </h2>
        <pre>      Dutch rabbits (a bit of a misnomer, since they were originally bred in England) are well-known for their 
unique color pattern. They are a bit larger than dwarf breeds, but still on the smaller side overall, averaging 3.5 to 5.5 lbs. 
They are a calm and easygoing breed, making them exceptional pets—especially for those with children. They can put up with the 
chaos of being frequently pet and held.</pre>
    
            <h2 align="center"><b>Personality</b></h2>
            <pre> Calm and gentle but will easily get depressed if left cooped up too long. Very sociable. </pre>

        <h2 align="center"><b>About the Breed</b> </h2>
        <pre>    Much like Dutch rabbits, Dwarf Hotots are known mostly for their unique coloring. They have entirely white coats, 
except for one small circle of color around their eyes. For years, the only Hotots that were allowed in shows were those 
with black spots, but recently, those with chocolate spots have also been given the OK to compete by the ARBA.
           
            They were not originally a dwarf breed. The larger Blanc de Hotot was bred in the early 1900s to be a 
black-eyed, white-haired rabbit that could be used for fur and meat. As both rabbit meat and fur went out of style,
and more people began keeping these critters as pets, dwarf breeds became increasingly popular, and the Dwarf Hotot 
breed was created.

            <h2 align="center"><b>Personality</b></h2>

and are easily trained. Mini Lops are great for anyone looking to have a litter-trained bunny. They are very sociable

Larger satin breeds became very popular when the satin gene was first recognized in 1956. From there, breeders went 
on to try to make a smaller version of these rabbits. Mini Satins are usually calm and friendly. However, they can

Mini Satin if you have a hectic house.</pre>

with children. They are, however, great pets for adults and make good companions for adults with disabilities.

            They enjoy human interaction but only in an environment where they feel safe and stable. Extremely 
small (usually between 1.1 and 2.5 lbs), these rabbits are better suited to a stable and quiet environment better 
than one with children running around. Despite their small size, these rabbits need a lot of exercise and do better 
in homes where they're free to run a good chunk of the day. They are skittish and aloof, which, again, is why they 
are not well-suited as children's pets.

was officially accepted into the American Rabbit Breeders Association in 2014. An energetic and affectionate
