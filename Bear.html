or 1760 pounds (lbs). In Ontario, the largest male bear recorded from “live capture” research studies 
weighed 654 kg (1439 lbs). The average weight of male polar bears in Ontario is about 500 kg (1100 lbs). 
Adult female bears are smaller and average around 300 kg (660 lbs); their peak weights do not usually 
exceed 400 kg (880 lbs). </pre>

        <pre>        Asiatic black bears have long black fur with a distinct white patch on the chest that is often crescent-shaped.
The fur around the shoulders and throat is particularly long, and their ears are relatively large. Asiatic black bears live 
in eastern Asia, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, India, Islamic Republic of Iran, Japan, 
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, 
Russian Federation, Taiwan and Vietnam.  

        Asiatic black bears are more carnivorous than their American counterparts, although only a small part of their 
diet is made up of meat. This includes small mammals, birds, fish, molluscs and carcasses. They also feed on grasses, 
fruits, berries, seeds, insects and honey. In autumn they fatten up for the winter by feeding on nuts. In northern 
climates they hibernate. In southern climates they do not hibernate.</pre>

        <h2 align="center"><b>About the Species</b> </h2>
        <pre>        Most scientists refer to spectacled bears as Andean bears (they are found only in the Andes mountains in 
South America). The bears are an endangered species, listed as Vulnerable, and it is illegal to kill them. The Andean bear 
is the last remaining short-faced bear (subfamily Tremarctinae) and the closest living relative to the Florida spectacled 
bear and short-faced bears of the Middle Pleistocene to Late Pleistocene age. Spectacled bears are the only surviving 
species of bear native to South America, and the only surviving member of the subfamily Tremarctinae. The Spectacled Bear 
is technically the largest land carnivore on that continent, although as little as 5% of its diet is composed of meat. South 
America’s largest obligate carnivore is the jaguar. Among South America’s extant, native land animals, only the Baird’s and 
South American Tapirs are heavier than this species. The Spectacled bear is a mid-sized species of bear. Overall its fur is
blackish in color, though bears may vary from jet black to dark brown and to even a reddish hue. 

            The species typically has distinctive beige-coloured marking across its face and upper chest, though not all 
Spectacled bears have “spectacle” markings. The pattern and extent of pale markings are slightly different on each 
individual bear and bears can be readily distinguished by this. Males are a third larger than females in dimensions 
and sometimes twice their weight. Compared to other living bears, this species has a more rounded face with a relatively 
short and broad snout. In some extinct species of the Tremarctinae subfamily, this facial structure has been thought to be
an adaptation to a largely carnivorous diet, despite the modern Spectacled bears’ herbivorous dietary preferences.  </pre>

            <pre>        The giant panda is a rare, endangered and elusive bear. Science used to believe that the giant 
panda was a member of the raccoon family. With DNA analyses science proved itself wrong. The giant panda and the red panda
are not related. Giant pandas are famous for their love of bamboo, a diet so nutritionally poor that the pandas have to 
consume up to 20kg each day. The extra digit on the panda’s hand helps them to tear the bamboo and their gut is covered with 
a thick layer of mucus to protect against splinters.
                
                Habitat loss is the greatest cause of the giant panda’s decline, and today their range is restricted to six 
eparate mountain ranges in western China. A giant panda is born pink, hairless, blind and 1/900th the size of its mother. 
Unlike other bears, giant pandas do not hibernate. In the winter, they move to lower elevations to keep warm, while
traveling to higher elevations in the summer to stay cool. They can be active at any time of the day or night. </pre>

        <pre>        These shaggy-haired bears can be heard sucking up termites a long distance away. Sloth bears are 
stocky with long, shaggy, black hair and a white U- or Y-shaped marking on the chest. They have large lips, a long tongue, 
a pale muzzle and well-developed hook-like claws that enable them to climb trees and dig for termites. Sloth bears live in
Sri Lanka, India, Bhutan, Nepal and Bangladesh. 
            
            Sloth bears are nocturnal and occupy home ranges that they seem happy to share with other sloth bears. 
Male sloth bears have an average range of 13 square km. This is much smaller than most other bears, probably due to the \
fact that they do not suffer from seasonal fluctuations of food supply (ants and termites are available all year round).
The constant availability of ants and termites also mean that they do not need to undergo a winter sleep. </pre>

yellow crescent on their chest. They have strong paws with naked soles and long sickle-shaped claws. They have flexible 
snouts and very long tongues, which are an adaptation for extracting termites from nests. Relatively(to their size), 
they have the largest canines of all the bear species. 
            
            Canine teeth are specialised for tearing meat, but sun bears are not particularly carnivorous. They may use 
their sharp canines as weapons or as tools for tearing at trees to get at insects. Sun bears live in south east Asia:

 Small individual populations are scattered throughout parts of Europe and Asia. Russia has a healthy population of 
 brown bears currently. Brown bears range in colour from almost black, brown to very light brown or blonde. 
                
 Size varies greatly depending on geographic location and general food availability. The largest bears, the 
 “Big Browns” exist along the coast of Alaska and Russia growing to very large sizes rivaling that of the Polar Bear. 
 The interior bears of the North American Rocky Mountains (Grizzly Bear) and the mountains of Europe tend to be much 
 smaller. The really big bears (1500pounds/700kg and bigger) are now very rare.</pre>

is common. The white colour phase is more rare occuring in north western British Columbia, Canada. The black
bear is omnivorous.
            
     Their diet is mostly vegetable matter. Males reach full size at about 8 years of age. Females mate and 
produce cubs at 5 to 7 years of age, 8 years and older in the boreal forest regions(Ontario). Males weigh up to 
280kg(600 pounds), occasionally much more. Black bears live up to 25 years in the wild. Older bears have been 
documented, however the majority of bears never reach old age due to human activity (hunting).</pre>
