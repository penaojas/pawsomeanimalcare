        <pre class="ab7">                 Today, many of the dogs you know and love are the product of 
            selective breeding between individuals with desirable traits, either 
        physical or behavioral. For instance, around 9,500 years ago, ancient
          peoples began breeding dogs that were best able to survive and work
            in the cold. These dogs would become the family of sled dogs—
              including breeds such as huskies and malamutes—that remains 
                                                  relatively unchanged today.
 
                 Similarly, humans bred German shepherds for their ability to herd 
         livestock, Labrador retrievers to help collect ducks and other game felled 
        by hunters, and sausage-shaped Dachshunds for their ability to rush 
          down a burrow after a badger. Many more breeds were created to fill
           other human needs, such as home protection and vermin control. 
              Certain breeds have also been created to make dogs more desirable 
                as companions. For instance, the labradoodle, which combines the
                 traits of a Labrador retriever and a poodle, was invented as an 
                                   attempt to create a hypoallergenic guide dog.</pre> <br> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

                  The cat is a very adorable animal. Cats can be kept as pets in our 
            houses as well. Their claws are quite sharp. They have extremely strong
               nocturnal eyesight. They also have two tiny ears. Cats have a short tail 
                 that helps them keep their balance when walking. The cat is an

        <pre class="ab7">                 Rabbits remain one of the nation’s favourite pets – and no wonder 
                          as they are amazing animals. But they're also one of the 
              most misunderstood. Rabbits are meticulously clean animals and are 
                  easy to house break and train.  Much like a dog, a pet rabbit can
            be taught to come to his/her name, sit in your lap, and do simple tricks.

                  Rabbits are mammals, which is an animal that has warm blood and 
              backbones. They are small, fluffy animals with short tails that look like 
                  a ball. They have long ears and whiskers. Their long legs let them 
                      hop around quickly. They can weigh one pound or even up to 
                            16 pounds! Rabbits can live for about 10 years. Some 
                                people call rabbits bunnies, but they are the same. </pre> <br> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <pre class="ab7">                 Hamsters are small rodents that are commonly kept as house pets. 
          They are distinguishable from other rodents due to their short tails, 
               stubby legs and small ears. Hamsters have many different colors, 
    including black, grey, brown, white, yellow, red or a mixture of several colors.

                 Hamsters are nocturnal, according to the ASPCA, which means they 
          like sleeping during the day. In the wild, they dig burrows, which are a 
            series of tunnels, to live and breed in. Hamsters will also store food in 
                their burrows. Living underground keeps wild hamsters cool in hot 
                                                                      climates.

                  Hamsters are popular pets, the most common and largest one being 
            the Syrian Hamster, also known as the ‘Golden Hamster’. The Syrian 
                  Hamster is naturally solitary and must be kept singular and not in 
                                                    pairs or groups as they will fight. </pre> <br> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

                        <pre class="ab7">                            Bears are multi-faceted individuals, not that unlike us. 
              Bear characteristics can only be generalized so much, but we’ll do 
                          our best to give you some general traits. Bears are highly 
              evolved social animals with intelligence comparable to that of the 
                    great apes. Bears often share friendship, resources and security. 
                    They form hierarchies and have structured kinship relationships.
                          
                          Bears are mammals that belong to the family Ursidae. They can
              be as small as four feet long and about 60 pounds (the sun bear) to as 
                  big as eight feet long and more than a thousand pounds. They’re 
                 found throughout North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.
                
                          On average, bears can live up to 25 years in the wild and 50 in 
                    captivity. Six species, including the polar bear and the giant panda, 
                         are included on the IUCN Red List as threatened or vulnerable. </pre> <br> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

                        <pre class="ab7">                     For all of their roaring, growling, and ferociousness, lions are 
          family animals and truly social in their own communities. They usually 
                              live in groups of 15 or more animals called prides.
                          
                      Lions have strong, compact bodies and powerful forelegs, teeth 
          and jaws for pulling down and killing prey. Their coats are yellow-gold, 
              and adult males have shaggy manes that range in color from blond 
                to reddish-brown to black. The length and color of a lion's mane 
          is likely determined by age, genetics and hormones. Young lions have 
                        light spotting on their coats that disappears as they grow.
                          
                      Without their coats, lion and tiger bodies are so similar that
