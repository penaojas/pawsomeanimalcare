            <h2 align="center"><b>About the Breed</b> </h2>
            <pre>        Syrian hamsters are one of the most common pets in Singapore due to their cuddly and docile nature. 
These charming furry babies are also known as golden hamsters or teddy bear hamsters. Also known as golden or teddy 
        bear hamsters, the Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) is the most popular pet hamster, especially for children.
    They range from from 5 to 9 inches in length and have a lifespan of two to four years. </pre> 

            <h2 align="center"><b>Personality Traits</b></h2>
            <pre>    • Easy to tame and handle
• Friendly and docile
• Solitary

They’re known to be the friendliest hamster breed for humans. As they’re solitary creatures, Syrians are best housed alone. 
                They’re known to fight and inflict harm on each other when housed together.</pre>

            <h2 align="center"><b>Care Requirements</b></h2>
                <pre>   In order to keep your Syrian healthy, an ideal diet should include:
                    
• Commercial hamster mixes
                     • Small pieces of fresh vegetables and fruits, 
                                    including apples, pears, broccoli, cauliflower and carrots
                                  • An occasional treat like nuts, grains, seeds or mealworms

     As Syrians are larger in size compared to other hamster breeds, they require a larger hamster wheel 
        and living space so that they can get their daily dose of exercise! </pre>

        <h2 align="center"><b>About the Breed</b> </h2>
        <pre>        The Chinese hamster (Cricetus griseus) can get up to five inches long. They can live up to three years.
   This species is known for being friendly and comfortable with handling if they are consistently tamed and handled from a 
   young age. Chinese hamsters are small rodents that came from the deserts of China and Mongolia. They’re often mistaken 
   as mice due to their pointed noise and noticeable tail.</pre> 

        <h2 align="center"><b>Personality Traits</b></h2>
        <pre>    • Friendly and doesn’t nip
• Prone to behavioural problems without enough interaction
• Territorial

Chinese hamsters need frequent attention and handling to keep them calm and satisfied. 
They may start chewing on anything they can get their teeth on when they’re bored or left alone for extended periods of time. </pre>

        <h2 align="center"><b>Care Requirements</b></h2>
            <pre>   Similar to other hamsters, Chinese hamsters will benefit from a diet of hamster food, fresh fruits and vegetables,
 nuts, grains, seeds and insects.

 As these hamsters require constant interaction, you can help by providing toys and space to keep them occupied and promote 
 their mental health. House them in separate cages if you have more than one until you’re absolutely 
 sure that they won’t harm each other. Alternatively, you can get littermates who are already used to each 
    other’s presence. For female Chinese hamsters, it’s best to house them separately as they 
can get more aggressive as they mature. </pre>

        <h2 align="center"><b>About the Breed</b> </h2>
        <pre>       The dwarf winter white Russian (Phodopus sungorus) is similar to the Campbell’s dwarf Russian hamster. 
    They are typically 3.5 to 4 inches long and live about two years. As their name suggests, winter white dwarf hamsters 
        originated from snowy regions. They also go by the names Siberian hamster and Djungarian hamster.  Interestingly, 
           their coats turn white in winter to help protect them from predators! They share a similar appearance to 
          Campbell’s dwarf hamsters, with the exception of having furry feet, smaller ears and a wider dorsal stripe. </pre> 

        <h2 align="center"><b>Personality Traits</b></h2>
        <pre>         • Sweet and mellow
• Social 
           • Playful and active

Winter white hamsters are easily tamed and enjoy the company of a same-sex companion. 
They’re very energetic hamsters that love to play. </pre>

        <h2 align="center"><b>Care Requirements</b></h2>
            <pre>   Winter white hamsters have no particular food requirements, but a balanced diet is essential to keep them in 
 good health and provide energy. Feed them a combination of fruits, vegetables, seeds, nuts, insects and hamster mixes! 

    As winter whites are extremely active and love to climb, having a cage with multiple levels and plenty of interactive
  toys for hamsters will prevent boredom. Tanks are a more ideal housing for these animals. They’re almost half the size of 
Syrians and are quite fast, which may allow them to escape through the gaps of traditional hamster cages.</pre>

        <h2 align="center"><b>About the Breed</b> </h2>
        <pre>     The Campbell’s dwarf Russian hamster (Phodopus campbelli) grows to a maximum of 4 inches and has an average
  life expectancy of two years. This is another social breed that can be kept in same-sex groups as long as the
    hamsters are properly introduced. With their round bodies and small size, Campbell’s dwarf hamsters have an adorable 
    look. It may be common to see pet stores naming them as “yellow pudding”, “blue pudding” or “sapphire” hamsters
    depending on their coat colour. </pre> 

        <h2 align="center"><b>Personality Traits</b></h2>
        <pre>    • Affectionate
• Easily frightened  
• Stubborn

When startled or grumpy, Campbells may resort to nipping. 
They tend to remain awake during the times they receive the most attention. </pre>

        <h2 align="center"><b>Care Requirements</b></h2>
            <pre>   Compared to other hamster breeds, Campbells are prone to diabetes. An ideal diet should consist of high protein content 
and minimal fruits to reduce sugar levels. For example, you can feed them about ⅙ of a grape each month as a snack. 
You can also consult your vet before feeding them any fruits. 

         When Campbells don’t feel comfortable, they may attempt to escape the cage. The best way to prevent this is to 
keep their housing well ventilated, to which a cage may be more ideal than a tank. As they’re rather timid, ensure that
there’s plenty of hiding places in the cage to make them feel safe when they’re sleeping or hiding. </pre>

       <h2 align="center"><b>About the Breed</b> </h2>
        <pre>     The smallest of the popular hamster breeds, the Roborovski dwarf hamster (Phodopus roborovski) matures to just 2
inches long. On average, these hamsters live about three years. Because this breed is so tiny, it is best to use an aquarium 
with a mesh lid to house these hamsters. Roborovski hamsters are the smallest hamster species and the fastest of the dwarf 
  breeds. They’re also called Robo dwarf hamsters. These hardy little animals aren’t especially prone to any illnesses.  </pre> 

        <h2 align="center"><b>Personality Traits</b></h2>
<pre>• Extremely shy 
  • Social with other hamsters  
• Possessive over belongings

Roborovskis are social creatures that love interacting with their own kind. However, 
they don’t enjoy being touched and may try to escape when being handled.  </pre>

        <h2 align="center"><b>Care Requirements</b></h2>
            <pre>   Feed your Roborovski with a tablespoon of hamster mix and small amounts of fresh food daily as 
they have very fast metabolisms.

       A tank may be more ideal than a cage because a cage has gaps where these agile creatures could escape through. 
 As Roborovskis dislike sharing, ensure that each hamster has their own toys, bowls and water bottles to prevent fighting. </pre>

<pre class="speciess">NOTE: </pre> <br> <br><br>

<pre class="speciesss">
        All hamsters require bedding at the bottom of their cage to keep them comfortable and as a way to burrow like they do in the wild. 
        You can use shredded paper and hardwood shavings. Cedar or pine-based bedding should be avoided as the smell can be toxic to them.
