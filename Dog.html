            <pre>       The mutt or mixed-breed dog of uncertain ancestry is number one. It is the irresistible dog found 
at the shelter, the brave and beloved protagonist of stories and books and movies and TV shows. It can have a smooth coat, 
a wiry coat, a curly coat or a wavy coat, long hair, or short hair. It can be a big dog or a small one, have pointed, erect 
ears or droopy ears, a long muzzle or a squashed-in face, a long straight tail, a bobtail, or a tail that curls over 
its back. 
                
        It can be all one color or many colors. Hybrid vigor has probably made it healthier than many purebreds and 
studies have shown that mutts live over a year longer than purebreds, which is a lot for a dog. No wonder the mutt is 
the most popular dog and probably always will be.

        <h2 align="center"><b>About the Breed</b> </h2>
        <pre>      The Labrador Retriever is the second most popular dog on the list. Unlike the golden retriever, 
which originated in Great Britain, this retriever originated in Canada to help fishermen haul in their nets. 
Its coat can also come in more colors than the golden’s, including black, yellow, chocolate, and silver. 
There are two types, the English and the American, with the English dog being more robust. The one trait that 
separates the Lab from the golden retriever is its tail, which resembles the tail of an otter and has no feathering.

The Lab is also a brilliant family dog, for it is patient, loving, very intelligent, and biddable. It loves to work and 
play and adores swimming and is just the pet for a family that has a swimming pool. The Lab is a strong dog, with a 
thick-muscled neck, a wide chest, barrel ribcage, and long shoulders. It stands from 21.5 to 22.5 inches at the shoulder 
and weighs between 55 and 75 pounds, though some big males can weigh over 100 pounds. Diet is one thing the Lab parent 
needs to take into account, for the dog is subject to obesity. It lives between 10 and 12 years.</pre>

        <h2 align="center"><b>About the Breed</b> </h2>
        <pre>      Another perennial favorite is the golden retriever. Bred to be a hunting dog, this dog is known 
for its alert and loving nature. It is just about the perfect dog for a household with young children as it is 
gentle and forbearing. Though some golden retriever parents dispute this, it also makes a good watchdog, as it will 
at least bark if it sees a stranger. The dog will not see them off, as it loves everybody. As a fairly large dog, 
it is ideal if it comes to a home with plenty of outdoor space but can do well in an apartment if it’s walked 
and exercised.

        The golden retriever comes in a shorthaired or longhaired form, and since its job was to retrieve waterfowl, 
its coat is dense and water-repellent. The golden retriever lives between 10 and 12 years, stands 20 to 24 inches high, 
and weighs between 60 and 80 pounds.</pre>

        <img src="quotation.png">
        <h2 align="center"><b>About the Breed</b> </h2>
        <pre>    The fourth most popular dog on the list is a long-time favorite, the German shepherd. Utterly 
courageous, confident, extremely loyal, and eager to please and to learn, the German shepherd lives for its family, 
whether it’s a family of four in the suburbs, a military unit, or a squad of rescue workers. As a big dog, it needs 
plenty of room and plenty of exercise, including a walk at least once a day. It especially loves to learn new tricks, 
even if it’s a relatively old dog.

        The German shepherd stands between 23 and 25 inches at the shoulders and weighs between 75 and 95 pounds, 
much of its muscle. It is known for its long, down-sloping body, erect, triangular ears, and long muzzle with a black 
nose. The top coat is hard and covers a dense undercoat, which sheds constantly and heavily at certain times of the year. 
This means the dog needs daily brushing. German shepherds live for around 13 years.</pre>

        <img src="quotation.png">
        <h2 align="center"><b>About the Breed</b> </h2>
        <pre>   The Goldendoodle is one of those crossbreed dogs that are becoming more and more popular. In this case, 
the cross is between a golden retriever and a poodle. They are not always the result of a purebred golden retriever and 
a purebred poodle but can be the result of a Goldendoodle and a poodle or two Goldendoodles. Breeders claim the golden 
retriever/purebred poodle mix is healthier, though the puppies in the same litter can have very different characteristics.

        People choose Goldendoodles because they blend the affectionate nature of the golden retriever with the poodle’s 
intelligence as well as its hypoallergenic fur. Since there’s not really a breed standard, the appearance of a golden 
doodle can vary though they tend to have strong limbs, a deep chest, and a long-haired coat that can be curly, straight, 
or wavy. They have a broad head, a long, strong body, and a feathered tail. Though they do shed, Goldendoodles are known 
to not shed as much as other dogs, especially if they have a lot of poodle in them. Depending on the type of coat they have,
these dogs may be prone to severe matting and require regular professional grooming to stay healthy.
All three coat types require frequent grooming.

        They also come in large, medium, and miniature sizes, with the large dog standing 20 to 24 inches at the shoulder, 
the medium standing 17 to 20 inches, and the miniature standing no more than 20 inches.

        <h2 align="center"><b>About the Breed</b> </h2>
        <pre>    Could the chihuahua be a good watchdog? It could, if only it were bigger, for it is fearless and loyal.
Many people have discovered to their dismay that this little companion dog can take over if it’s not given a firm but loving 
hand. This is one reason why the chihuahua isn’t the best dog to have around children because children will pamper it, 
and it can become snappy if it’s convinced that it outranks them in the pack. But the chihuahua is just the pet for an 
apartment, though like other small dogs it needs to be kept warm, and like all dogs, it needs to have its daily walk.

    Another benefit of the chihuahua is its long life. It can live 15 years or longer, even in the midst of health problems 
that would have defeated larger dogs. Chihuahuas can come in long or shorthaired, apple head or deer head forms. 
Shorthaired chihuahuas only need to be brushed now and then, but dogs with long coats need to be brushed daily. Both need 
to be carefully bathed every month or so. The chihuahua is only 6 to 9 inches high at the shoulder and weighs only 2 to 6 
pounds.</pre>

        <h2 align="center"><b>About the Breed</b> </h2>
        <pre>   This dog is known for pulling sleds through forbidding wintry conditions. This is no problem for the 
Siberian husky, for it is both powerful and comes with a well-insulated coat. Besides the ability to work hard, the dog is 
playful and sweet-natured. It is a good dog for a family with young children and seems eager to meet new people, which does 
not recommend it as a watchdog. A dog as energetic as the husky needs plenty of room to run around in and lots of exercise. 
This makes it a great jogging companion, especially when the weather is on the cooler side.

        The husky’s looks reveal its wolf ancestry. It has the wolf’s longish muzzle and triangular, erect ears, its deep 
chest, long legs and heavy, bushy tail, and eyes that can be blue or brown or both. It even engages in communal howling. 
But the husky is much smaller than the wolf, standing at between 20 and 23.5 inches at the shoulder and weighing between 
35 and 60 pounds.</pre>

        <h2 align="center"><b>About the Breed</b> </h2>
        <pre> The eighth most popular dog on the list is this tiny firecracker from Great Britain. Bred to hunt rats, 
the Yorkie makes up for its size with its confidence and intelligence. Because it’s so tiny, it’s probably not the best 
bet for very young and energetic children. On the other hand, it is perfect for a small apartment as long as it is walked 
every day. Like many diminutive dogs, it’s not as tolerant of cold as larger dogs despite its abundant coat. That coat, 
by the way, is remarkable for its straight and silky fur, which is tan on the head and muzzle and a lovely steel blue 
everywhere else.

            If allowed to, the Yorkie’s coat can grow until it touches the ground. If the owner lets this happen, the dog 
will need a great deal of grooming. Even a coat that’s clipped to make it manageable needs to be combed and brushed, and 
the fur on the face is so long it can be gathered up in a top knot and held with a bow. The dog is only 9 inches high at 
the shoulder and weighs less than 7 pounds.</pre>

        <h2 align="center"><b>About the Breed</b> </h2>
        <pre> Don’t fear the pitbull! Despite its reputation, a well-trained American pit bull terrier is an intelligent, 
devoted, and fearless protector of its family. Since it was originally bred, unfortunately, for pit fighting, it is a 
supremely powerful animal with a broad chest, well-muscled neck, thick skull, and a famously powerful bite. It is a hardy 
breed and not subject to the sorts of maladies that afflict less robust dogs.

            While these dogs have a sweet temper and can make great pets, they are very powerful carnivores. All dogs can 
become aggressive in certain circumstances. The sheer power, athleticism and strength of these dogs is what makes them 
dangerous if they do become aggressive. Like all dogs, pitbulls require exercise and appropriate training.
            
            The American pit bull stands between 14 and 24 inches tall at the shoulder and weighs between 22 and 78 pounds. 
Its coat is shorthaired, sheds moderately, and is a cinch to groom with regular brushing followed by rubbing with a 
chamois cloth.</pre>

        <img src="quotation.png">
        <h2 align="center"><b>About the Breed</b> </h2>
        <pre>This lively, enthusiastic dog was actually developed in the United States and has ancestry in the dogs 
brought to the US with sheep from Australia. It was bred to herd sheep and cattle, and because of that, it loves the rough 
and tumble and is great with even rambunctious children. Their shepherd nature also makes these dogs loyal, devoted and 
obedient, which is why it’s often used as a search and rescue dog. Clearly, the Australian shepherd needs a lot of exercise 
and a job to do otherwise it becomes bored and fractious.

            The Australian shepherd stands about 18 to 23 inches tall at the shoulder and weighs between 35 and 70 pounds. 
It has beautiful, thick, somewhat coarse fur with a ruff around its chest and neck. Using a brush with stiff bristles is 
recommended regularly. The Australian shepherd lives about 12 to 15 years. </pre>
